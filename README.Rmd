# movMFnoise

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An R package for fitting **mixture models of von Mises-Fisher distributions** with an optional **uniform noise component** on the unit hypersphere. The package implements an EM algorithm optimized for directional data and follows the mclust modeling convention.

## Overview

The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is the spherical analog of the multivariate normal distribution and is widely used for modeling directional data such as:

- Text document analysis (word embeddings, topic models)
- Bioinformatics (protein structure, gene expression)
- Earth sciences (paleomagnetism, wind directions)
- Computer vision (orientation data)

**movMFnoise** extends standard vMF mixture models by allowing a uniform noise component to capture outliers and uniformly distributed observations on the hypersphere.

## Key Features

- **EM algorithm** for von Mises-Fisher mixture models
- **Automatic model selection** across multiple values of G (number of components)
- **Optional uniform noise component** following mclust convention
- **Multiple random starts** for robust parameter initialization
- **Model selection criteria**: BIC and ICL
- **S3 methods** for prediction, summary, and classification

## Installation

You can install the development version of movMFnoise from GitHub:

```r
# Install from GitHub
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("AndreaCappozzo/movMFnoise")
```

The package requires the `movMF` package for data simulation and internal computations:

```r
install.packages("movMF")
```

## Quick Start

```r
library(movMFnoise)

# Simulate data: 2 clusters + uniform noise on 3D sphere
set.seed(123)
n <- 130
x1 <- movMF::rmovMF(50, theta = c(10, 0, 0))  # Cluster 1
x2 <- movMF::rmovMF(50, theta = c(0, 5, 0))   # Cluster 2
noise <- matrix(rnorm(30 * 3), ncol = 3)
noise <- noise / sqrt(rowSums(noise^2))       # Uniform noise
data <- rbind(x1, x2, noise)

# Fit model with noise component
fit <- fit_movMFnoise(data, G = 2, noise = TRUE, 
                      control = control_movMFnoise(nstart = 5))

# View results
summary(fit)
table(fit$classification)  # 0 = noise, 1:G = components
```
