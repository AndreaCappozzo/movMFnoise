Description: Fits mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions with a noise 
    component on the high-dimensional unit hypersphere using the EM algorithm. 
    The package provides functions for model estimation, model selection via 
    BIC and ICL, and includes a noise component to handle outliers and uniform 
    noise. It follows the same conventions as the 'movMF' package for 
    parameterization and concentration parameter (kappa) computation.
